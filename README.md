# React + Django REST Todo List

## Technologies Used:
- ReactJS
- Django REST API
- Webpack
- Babel

## Functionality:
The todo list utilizes Django REST API's CRUD functionality to allow the user to add, update, delete, and manage tasks.

## Purpose:
I "created" this app to allow myself to learn how to meld together three different parts of a full-stack application, namely the frontend, the backend, and the API. I heavily borrowed ideas from YouTube and stackoverflow in order to accomplish this.
